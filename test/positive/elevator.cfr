/*
1. Elevator door is by default closed
2. Door can't be opened unless an elevator button is pressed (if it is empty) or it reached the 
level it wants (if it has a person inside)
3. Door can't be closed again unless the maximum weight that the elevator can carry is not 
exceeded
4. Elevator can't move unless a button from inside is pressed.
5. The elevator has to check current floor to decide whether to go up or down (Can't go up when 
you are already on top floor, and can't go down if you are already on bottom floor)
6. The elevator can only move up or down if a destination floor is given or a calling floor are 
different from the current floor

/*
Given this single example, I can already see a flaw: "why is the elevator moving up"? 
Since, the person has not requested a destination floor, this could only happen if somebody higher
than the current floor has called the elevator. But this aspect is missing from the description */
