# Clafer Instance Generator

##### v0.5.1

[Clafer](http://clafer.org) is a powerful (equivalent to first-order predicate logic) yet lightweight structural modeling language. Despite simplicity and conciseness of Clafer, writing correct models remains challenging due to hard-to-predict interactions among all constraints expressed in the model.

**Clafer instance generator** (ClaferIG) is an interactive tool that generates instances and counter examples of concrete clafers in a Clafer model. If the concrete clafers do not have contradicting constraints, the generator produces valid instance data. Otherwise, the generator produces an unsatisfiable core which included all contradicting constraints and generates a counter example by removing one constraint from the core. The generator can potentially produce many instances if the concrete clafers are not fully specialized. The generator produces different instances on-demand. With these capabilities, the instance generator can be used for debugging models: checking the consistency of the model and detecting under- and overconstraining of the model. The instance generator can also be used programmatically via API (the command line and interactive session interfaces only use the API).

## Getting the Clafer Instance Generator

Clafer can be installed from a binary distribution (preferred), from Hackage, and from the source code.

### Dependencies for running

Regardless of the installation method, the following are required:

* [Clafer](https://github.com/gsdlab/clafer) v0.5.1
* [Java Platform (JDK)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) v8+, 64bit
  * On Windows, Java must be 32bit because of Alloy, 64bit otherwise
* [Alloy4.2](http://alloytools.org/download)

### Installation from binaries

Binary distributions of the release 0.5.1 of Clafer Tools for Windows, Mac, and Linux,
can be downloaded from [Clafer Tools - Binary Distributions](http://gsd.uwaterloo.ca/clafer-tools-binary-distributions).

1. download the binaries and unpack `<target directory>` of your choice,
2. add the `<target directory>` to your system path so that the executables can be found.

### Installation From Hackage

Clafer is now available on [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/claferIG-0.5.1/) and it can be installed using either [`stack`](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack) or [`cabal-install`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cabal-install).

#### Installation using `stack`

Stack is the only requirement: no other Haskell tooling needs to be installed because stack will automatically install the needed Haskell build tools.

1. [install `stack`](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack#how-to-install)
2. Execute
  * `stack install claferIG`
  * ``` cd `stack --local-bin-path` ```
  * `wget http://alloytools.org/download/alloy4.2_2015-02-22.jar`
  * `mv alloy4.2_2015-02-22.jar alloy4.2.jar`
  * `wget https://github.com/gsdlab/claferIG/raw/master/alloyIG.jar`
  * `mkdir lib`
  * `cd lib`
  * Depending on your OS:
    * for Win, `stack exec wget --  https://github.com/gsdlab/claferIG/raw/master/lib/libminisatprover.dll`
    * for Linux, `wget https://github.com/gsdlab/claferIG/raw/master/lib/libminisatprover.so`
    * for Mac, `wget https://github.com/gsdlab/claferIG/raw/master/lib/libminisatprover.dylib`

#### Installation using `cabal-install`

Dependencies

* [GHC](https://www.haskell.org/downloads) >= 8.4.4 is recommended,
* `cabal-install` >= 2.2, should be installed together with a GHC distribution,

1. Install GHC
2. `cabal update`
3. `cabal install claferIG`
4. `cd <cabal's lib or share folder>`  (`C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\cabal\x86_64-windows-ghc-8.4.4\claferIG-0.5.1` on Windows or `.cabal/share/x86_64-linux-ghc-8.4.4/claferIG-0.5.1/` on Linux)
5. to automatically download alloy4.2.jar
  * execute `make alloy4.2.jar`
7. copy the following into the Cabal's `bin` folder
  * the file `alloyIG.jar`
  * the file `alloy4.2.jar`
  * the folder `lib`

### Installation from the source code

Dependencies

* [GHC](https://www.haskell.org/downloads) >= v8.4.4
* [Clafer compiler](https://github.com/gsdlab/clafer) (to produce Alloy models (`.als`)).
* On Linux, might need to manually install `zlib1g-dev` and `libncurses5-dev` to build one of Haskell packages on which ClaferIG depends
  * on Ubuntu, execute `sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev`

On Windows

* [MSYS2](http://msys2.sourceforge.net/)
* it is installed automatically by `stack setup` (see Building below)
* update MSYS2 packages
   * follow [III. Updating packages](http://sourceforge.net/p/msys2/wiki/MSYS2%20installation/) but always execute `stack exec pacman -- <arguments for pacman>`
* execute
   * `stack exec pacman -- -S make wget unzip diffutils`

### Important: branches must correspond

All related projects are following the *simultaneous release model*.
The branch `master` contains releases, whereas the branch `develop` contains code under development.
When building the tools, the branches should match.
Releases from branches 'master` are guaranteed to work well together.
Development versions from branches `develop` should work well together but this might not always be the case.

### Building

1. install the [Clafer compiler](https://github.com/gsdlab/clafer)
2. in some `<source directory>`, execute `git clone git://github.com/gsdlab/claferIG.git`
3. in `<source directory>/claferIG`, execute `stack setup`. This will install all dependencies, build tools, and MSYS2 (on Windows).
4. `cd <source directory>/claferIG`
  * `make`

### Installation

1. execute `make install to=<target directory>`

#### Note:
> On Windows, use `/` with the `make` command instead of `\`, e.g., `make install to=/c/clafer-tools-0.5.1/`

`claferIG <model file name>.cfr`

- opens an interactive session and displays an instance or a counterexample.

`claferIG <model file name>.cfr -all <scope>`

- opens a non-interactive session and saves all instances up to the provided scope or a counterexample to files named `<model file name>.cfr.<instance number>.data`, one instance per file.

## Interactive Session Usage

In the interactive mode, the users can invoke the following commands by pressing a letter marked in  the command name between '' or the whole command as marked by '':

```

## Output format

There are two output formats: native (plain text, default) and JSON (`--json`).

### Instance data (native)

The instance data notation is very similar to a regular Clafer notation for concrete clafers with a few differences:

* no constraints
* no types and super types
    * except when `--useuids --addtypes` parameters are used
* no clafer and group cardinalities (each clafer has the default group `(0..*)` and clafer `(1..1)` cardinality)
* no clafers not present in the instance

Additionally, the data notation contains concrete values of the clafers and suffix numbers to distinguish among multiple instances of the same clafer.

### Note:
> The instance data models could be read by the Clafer translator if the translator had simple type inference support.

#### Example

For a model

```
abstract A
    a ?
    b +
    c -> integer ?
    d -> E 2
    g -> E 2
        h -> integer

abstract E
    f ->> integer +

a1 : A
e1 : E
e2 : E
```

A possible instance data looks as follows:

```
=== Instance 1 Begin ===

a1
    b$1
    b$2
    c -> 10
    d$1 -> e1
    d$2 -> e2
    g1 -> e1
        h$1 -> 5
    g2 -> e2
        h$2 -> 2

e1
    f$1 -> 2
    f$2 -> 3
    f$3 -> 4
    f$4 -> 2

--- Instance 1 End ---
```

### Near-miss instance

Near-miss instance notation is the same as the instance data notation. Additionally, it indicates which constraints belong to the UnSAT Core.

#### Example

For a model

```
abstract A
    a ?
    b ?
        [ a ]   // C1

a1 : A
    [ no a ]    // C2
    [ b ]       // C3
```

Constraints C1, C2, and C3 form an UnSAT Core. Removal of any of them will make the model satisfiable. The constraint C1 is part of the model and cannot be removed (part of domain knowledge). Therefore, either C2 or C3 must be removed to remove the inconsistency.

On possible near-miss instance:

```
a1
    a
    b
```

Here, `C1` and `C3` are satisfied but `C2` is not. To resolve the conflict and assuming that the counter example is actually a correct instance data, the user has to modify the model by removing `C2`. However, should the counter example actually represent incorrect instance data, the user can remove `C3` to resolve the inconsistency.

## Troubleshooting


If you get an error:

```
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no minisatproverx1 in java.library.path
 at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadLibrary(Unknown Source)
 at java.lang.Runtime.loadLibrary0(Unknown Source)
 at java.lang.System.loadLibrary(Unknown Source)
 at org.clafer.ig.AlloyIG.main(AlloyIG.java:275)
```

it means that you have a 64bit Java on Windows instead of the required 32bit one.
On Windows, Alloy only supports Minisat with UnSAT core on 32bit Java.
There's nothing we can do.

## How it works

The Clafer instance generator:

* translates the input Clafer model (.cfr) to an Alloy4.2 model (.als). The compiler's intermediate representation (IR) contains the mapping between Clafer names and Alloy names. The IR also contains the scopes for each Alloy signature to ensure that a valid instance can be found if it exists
* invokes Alloy Analyzer to produce an instance or find an UnSAT core
** given an UnSAT core, removes constraints from the core until an instance is found - that instance represents the counterexample which violates the removed constraints
* translates the instance or the counterexample data produced by Alloy Analyzer to Clafer instance data format using the name map from IR in a reverse direction,
* for a counterexample, translates the counter example in Alloy to Claefr instance data and constraint violations in Alloy into constraint violations in Clafer model
